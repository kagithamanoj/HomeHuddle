# Home Huddle — Project Scaffold (Frontend)

Home Huddle is an all-in-one daily life assistant web app covering home maintenance, pet care, and shared living.  
This documentation summarizes our robust, scalable frontend setup using React, TypeScript, React Router, Zustand, and modern best practices.

---

## 1. Tech Stack Overview

- **React**: UI library for components and SPA architecture
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for maintainability and safety
- **Vite**: Bundler for rapid development
- **React Router v6+**: Routing between pages/features
- **Zustand**: Global state management (user, features, UI)
- **React Query**: Data fetching, caching, and API sync
- **Axios**: Robust network requests
- **SVG & CSS**: Custom icons, branding, stylesheets

## 3. Architecture Notes

- **Public/assets:** Contains static files and brand images/icons for rapid, responsive UI.
- **App & main:** Entry and root composition, routes, error boundary, and suspense for lazy loading.
- **Pages:** High-level containers mapped 1:1 with routes; glue together features/components.
- **Components:** Reusable UI widgets—Navbar, Footer, Loader, Modal, Toast, Sidebar.
- **Features:** Domain modules—each folder encapsulates a core part of app logic & views.
- **Hooks:** Custom hooks for auth, storage, input debounce, and device size.
- **API:** All backend requests, modularized per feature, using Axios, with global error/token handling.
- **Store:** Global state managed per feature, with Zustand (user, tasks, expenses, UI, etc.).
- **Utils:** Helper functions for formatting, validation, error messaging, and array/data handling.
- **Types:** Strict TypeScript interfaces assure robust API/store integration and safety.

## 4. Usage Examples

**Component import & use**

## 5. Key Features & Best Practices

- **Centralized API and modular state management for scalable growth.**
- **SVG icons and custom assets for crisp UX.**
- **Pluggable, feature-first architecture—each module (home, pet, shared living) is easy to develop/enhance.**
- **Type-safe data models throughout ensure stable, consistent app logic.**
- **Error boundary and suspense for graceful UX during loading/errors.**

## 6. Next Steps

Add more branding assets, convert initial wireframes into full feature implementations, and expand per-feature logic as backend endpoints evolve.  
Use this markdown for onboarding, code review, and team documentation.
